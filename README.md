# Purpose
A small script that automates the process of getting an NIE appointment in Barcelona. The script checks for new appointment slots all 5 seconds and automatically executes the registration. For it to work, you need a working Spanish mobile phone number.

The script can only be automated partly, as you will receive an SMS mid way and you have then to input the remaining information manually.

# Installation

To use this script, you need to install Selenium with

```
pip install selenium
```
